# Prototype1 Test Cases - Comprehensive Breaking Guide

## Overview
This document contains comprehensive test cases for the PayNearMe IVA Prototype to systematically identify breaking points and edge cases.

## Flow Summary
1. **SMS/iMessage Flow** (Steps 0-2): Payment request → User response → Payment failure
